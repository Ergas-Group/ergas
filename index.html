We have a flexible philosophy to investing and, as such, our investment mandate spans into other asset classes and verticals that offer capital stewardship and attractive risk reward profiles. As investors of our personal wealth, long-term value creation is our principal goal.

        <h3>Acquisitions</h3>
        <p>
          We actively source, capitalize, and manage real estate investment opportunities in both the United States and Canada. We evaluate investments that offer underlying value creation opportunities, either through value-add strategies or by acquiring well-located assets in markets with robust fundamentals and high growth potential. Our experience spans almost all real estate sectors including office, retail, residential, and industrial, but we have always maintained a heavily concentrated focus in US multifamily.

We offer our partners a diverse expertise in development, acquisitions, and finance. With carefully selected partners, we build long-standing relationships that lead to well executed projects.
