      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        Ergas Group is the investment group for the Ergas Family. We are comprised of many family-owned companies and partnerships, that are involved in the acquisition, development, management, and finance of commercial and residential properties in the United States and Canada. We have a flexible philosophy to investing and, as such, our investment mandate spans other asset classes and verticals that offer capital stewardship and attractive risk reward profiles. As investors of our proprietary capital, long-term value creation is our principal goal.
        <br><br>
        The Ergas family office continues to carry three generations of representation. The family originates from the Araucaria region of central Chile and has established deep roots in North America after emigrating to Canada’s West Coast. It is imperative to us that our core familial values of integrity, kindness and discipline are always upheld as we contribute to our stakeholders: our partners, customers, and the economy and communities in which we operate.
